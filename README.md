_The modern home of computer animated animatronic simulations_

FlooferLand's Animatronic Runtime is an simulation and animation engine for animatronic shows the like of [The Rockafire Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SeSavNd9_c&list=PLB8A625C54121DA04)
This project will let you create and animate shows without investing hundreds of dollars making a real animatronic, as well as letting you animate real world animatronics by exporting a selection of shows to an Arduino-compatible board.

## Planned features
- Create and watch shows
- Create mechs using a modular in-game system and dress them up with costumes you've made in Blender or any other modeling software.
- Damage mechanics _(VHS tape damage, etc)_ as well as auto-correction and repair software you can build yourself
- Realistic way to animate performances, having to press buttons live _(or at 0.5x speed)_, with an optional fully-fledged editor
- A band selection screen to let you choose and manage which animatronic band you'd like to watch, including credit for the people that made the band, the company that is behind it, the voice actors, etc.
- A safe sandboxed Lua scripting system that allows for users to make things the likes of a show selector
- Online features such as a place to download user-made mechs, costume pieces, scriptable props, shows for specific bands, band packs, etc. Possible Steam Workshop support if this game ever gets on there.
- Flatscreen + VR support
- Simple mech retargeting
- Planned story mode, with included spookies.
- Good performance on low-end systems, and a built-in video renderer to let you export out shows as smooth 60 FPS ultra graphics video even on a potato system.
- Available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Web, and potentially on the Wii U just for fun

## NOTE: This is not a Rockafire Explosion simulator
Rockafire Explosion characters will not be included _(unless Aaron specifically gives this project permission)_, and CEC characters won't be included.

We have our own band, and we let you make your own!
